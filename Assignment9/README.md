<h3>What's Needed?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A PS5. Could be any model, but this instructable is mainly for the Slim model.</b></li>
            <li><b>A small Phillips screwdriver.</b></li>
            <li><b>A SSD storage expansion.</b></li>
        </ul>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<b>If you have a disc drive, remove the game disc. Fully power off the PlayStation, and unplug it. Move the console to a flat table and flip it so that the stands are facing up, also the side that doesn't have the PlayStation logo in the corner.</b>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Remove the Cover</h3>
- Remove the smaller, cover that is towards the top of the console by prying up the front.
<h3>Step 2: Locate and Remove the Expansion Slot Cover</h3>
- It should be silver and stand out from the rest of the console. Find the screw at the top and remove it and the cover.
<h3>Step 3: Remove the Smaller Screw and Spacer</h3>
- Inside the slot there is a smaller screw and spacer that should be removed and set aside, as they will be used after the SSD is placed.
<h3>Step 4: Install the SSD</h3>
- There should be a small diagram of how the SSD should be lined up, then push the SSD into the pins.
<h3>Step 5: Use the Spacer and Screw to Secure the SSD</h3>
- Place the spacer under the end of the SSD and use the smaller screw to secure the expansion card in its spot.
<h3>Step 6: Replace the Cover</h3>
- Put the expansion slot cover back and replace the screw.
<h3>Step 7: Replace the PS5 Cover</h3>
- Allign the hooks, and push down on the cover.
<h3>Step 8: Check the PlayStation</h3>
- Plug the console back in and turn it on. Go to settings and scroll down to storage. Select it and there should be a option called M.2 SSD Storage.
<h2>Extra Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A magnetic screwdriver is useful if you have it, but it isn't necassery by any means.</b></li>
            <li><b>The PS5 cover can be a pain to put back. I found that I had to put quite a bit of force into getting it to clip back in.</b></li>
            <li><b>Make sure to keep track of the smaller screw and the spacer. The spacer is exceptionally prone to rolling away.</b></li>
            <li><b>The SSD does require some force to fully connect, but as long as it is alligned correctly it should be simple to install.</b></li>
