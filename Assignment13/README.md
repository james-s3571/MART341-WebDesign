Div - I used divs to seperate the different elements of my page such as the paragraphs, images, and videos. This will help me keep my pages organized and easy to navigate.

Span - I used span to put italics on a game title and to change the boldness and color of the score that I gave the game. This will help keep my code simple, and reusable.

Audio - I used audio to give the reader a choice to play some sounds that I thought reflected the theme of the game, adding more to the experience.

Video - I used a video to show off a short section of gameplay. This gives the reader some context for what I was discussing in the previous paragraph.

Iframe - I used an Iframe to do the same thing as a video, but since I can host the video somewhere else, I could make the video longer.

Class - I used class to center my text and media, which makes the page look much nicer.

Escape character - I used an escape character to put an ampersand in my text.
