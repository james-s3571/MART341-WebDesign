Responsive Design - I incorporated this through using percentages for my images, videos. and boxes.

Media Queries - I used this to make sure each piece of media scales correctly.

Navigation Menu - I included a navigation bar at the top to make sure that users can navigate the site easily.

Dropdown Menu - I added this to the navigation bar to make sure it remains simple and looks good.
