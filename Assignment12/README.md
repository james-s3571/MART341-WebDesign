I worked on the forms.html for this assignment.

Sizing – I used sizing to control the image and boxes on the page. I changed their sizes to fit more smoothly onto the page.
Border – By using borders to enclose the contents inside their box, the page looks nicer and is more organized.
Margin – I used margin to make the boxes and image have some space between them. It helped to keep the page from looking cluttered.
Padding – I used padding in the box that has text in it to make sure it wasn't too crowded.
Display: Inline / Inline-block – I used this to make sure that the image and the navigation elements stay where they need to be.
Position – I used this to keep my navigation bar at the top of the screen even if the user scrolls down.
