Part One:
I have decided to develop my game review website further. I think that this would allow me to be the most creative, and it could give me more chances to learn new elements of design. It will take some more work than my other two ideas just because it will require more writing, but I'm excited to give it a try.

Reflection:
To achieve balance on my website, I tried to keep some empty space so that it isn't overwhelming. I tried to use the images to break up the page as well. My final design was slightly different than the idea I originally had. I thought of the layout of the images immediately, and I'm happy that it made it to the final page. The rest of the website was done as I went because I didn't have an idea for it. I am very happy that I used float and margin. I thought it was pretty easy to understand. The main issue that I had was getting the text to go where I wanted it to. I mainly fixed this through trial and error. I'm pretty happy with the website so far, and I'm excited to continue to work on it. I am curious how to make images stay how they are because, on my laptop, the images on my website are lined up perfectly, but on my monitor, they move around. I don't know if that is even possible, but I am curious to know if it can be done.
