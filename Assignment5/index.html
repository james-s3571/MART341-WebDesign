<h2>First Idea</h2>
<p>One website idea that I have is a place where I can show the projects I've worked on and working on. It would have a profesional tone.</p>

<br />

<h2>Second Idea</h2>
<p>My second idea is to make a website relating to me. I could put major events or other stuff I want to put on there. It would have a more relaxed tone, but it would be a pretty boring website.</p>

<h2>Third Idea</h2>
<p>My final idea is for a website that I can put game reviews on. I think it would be cool to have a website that has my opinions on games. This would have a professional tone, but it could also be open to different tones.</p>
