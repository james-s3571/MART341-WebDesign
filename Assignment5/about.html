<h2>First Idea</h2>
<p>My first idea would be a good thing to have because it would be a good thing to have. It could be very serious and organized as well.</p>

<br />

<h2>Second Idea</h2>
<p>My second idea is for to think of anything cool and put it on the website. It could be cool to update it with any major happenings. It would be less professional as it wouldn't be for business.</p>

<br />

<h2>Third Idea</h2>
<p>This is just a random idea that I had, but I think it would be cool to make. It would be professional, but it also could change according to the game being talked about.</p>
