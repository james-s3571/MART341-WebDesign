1. How did the peer review go for the discussion? Was it easier to remember to post and reply with this format? Can I help out with anything specific?:

I didn't feel that the peer review was much different from the previous response. For me, it didn't make too much of a difference with posting and replying. 

2. README List:

I'm working on the index.html page.

3. Required Techniques (Must Have):

Create a page with an external CSS style sheet
Use at least 1 class selector
Use at least 1 ID selector

I used the class selector multiple times to apply my changes from the css page.
I used the ID selector to target a specific element to change.

4. Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

I changed the main background color to add some contrast.
The text color was also changed to make it stand out.
I lowered the images opacity to make it less attention grabbing, so the quote would stanmd out more when placed on it.
