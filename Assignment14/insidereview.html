            <p>Playdead's Inside is one of the most memorable games that I have ever played. Every single element was crafted, and then perfectly tuned to evoke a certain feeling out of the player. The game's story reminds me of Naughty Dog's <span class="italics">The Last of Us</span>, in that there is almost nothing to uplift the player. The world is dark, the people are cruel, and everything wants to kill you. The gameplay is extremely simple, the player can run left, right, and jump. The game never stops to explain any of its mechanics to the player, which I really liked, as it makes the player just as clueless as the kid that they are playing as.

                Gameplay from Inside that shows the playable character jumping from a roof to a pipe.

            <p>The story is also one of the most interesting parts of the game, but it is very cryptic. The game does a great job of giving the player the pieces needed to understand what is happening in the moment, but it is up to the player to figure out what is fully happening. To progress through the story though, the player must solve puzzles that block their path. Each of these puzzles is expertly crafted &amp; utilizes already-established mechanics really well. I never felt lost, as I knew I just had to search around or think for another minute about how to continue.

            <p>The sound is also a huge element that adds to the intensity of this game. The sound makes the game feel so much more alive, which is ironic in a couple of ways. The sound makes the world feel empty, but that is a good thing. It makes the tension feel real. It also makes the parts that are louder more poignant. The stinger that plays when an enemy gets close had a much larger impact because of the silence that accompanied me for most of the game. This game is <span class="score">Fantastic.</span>
