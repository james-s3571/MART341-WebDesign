            <p>I will be the first to admit that I am not good at racing games. That being said, Polyphony Digital's <span class="italics">Gran Turismo 7</span> is still a great racing simulator. My experience with racing games is quite limited. I remember renting <span class="italics">Forza Motorsport</span> 3 when I was younger, and I also played a lot of <span class="italics">Forza Horizon 4</span>. Gran Turismo is much more serious in terms of racing mechanics than either of the Forza Motorsport titles and certainly more than the more acrcade-based Forza Horizon. Gran Turismo 7 has so many moving parts and it would be quite easy to become overwhelmed, however, the game is excellent at slowly integrating the player into all the different systems. The early tutorials describe the simple mechanics well, and the game ramps up the difficulty after the player has put in some time.

            <p>The game has some great immersive elements. The graphics look amazing and the sound that each car makes sounds accurate. The game has a multitude of options that make every race feel distinct. It has many racetracks and even different times of the day that the player can choose from. The amount of cars in the game is staggering. The menu is unique in it is a top-down view of a town with a bunch of different buildings that each serve a different function. There are buildings for buying cars, detailing cars, multiplayer, and more. It helps to immediately immerse the player in the world.

            <p>I haven't explored the different options that the game has in terms of racing. As I said, there is a multiplayer, but I haven't tested it out. I primarily stick to single-player racing. I likely have barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. This game is <span class="score">Fantastic.</span>
